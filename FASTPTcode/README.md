# FAST-PT

FASTPT is a code to calculate 1-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in cosmology. 
The code utilizes Fourier methods combined with analytic expressions to reduce the computation time down 
to scale as N log N, where N is the number of grid point in the input linear power spectrum. 

FAST-PT way to get started: 

* Make sure you have current numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
* download
* in terminal type the following 
* python FASTPT.py
* (hopefully you get a plot)

See the user_manual.pdf for more details. 

Our paper (arXiv:1603.04826 ) describes the FAST-PT algorithm and implementation. This paper should be cited when using FAST-PT in your research.
